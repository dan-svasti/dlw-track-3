This is the solution to DLW Backup Track 3, which revolves around creating a deep learning solution that resolves the gap in proper security for underserved rural communities.

Our solution is a computer vision model that leverages Ultralytics' YOLOv8-nano (pre-trained DL human detection model) for the purpose of detecting crowds of anomalous size that persist past a certain time threshold,
and subsequently sending an alert message to the end user.

The repository has detailed PDF documentation and an MP4 demo video to see the decisions behind the solution and the solution in action respectively.
